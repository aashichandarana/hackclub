        <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications in China. They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.</p>
        <h2>Petra:</h2>

        <p>Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's southwestern desert. Dating to around 300 B.C., it was the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom. Accessed via a narrow canyon called Al Siq, it contains tombs and temples carved into pink sandstone cliffs, earning its nickname, the "Rose City." Perhaps its most famous structure is 45m-high Al Khazneh, a temple with an ornate, Greek-style facade, and known as The Treasury.</p>
        <h2>Christ the Redeemer:</h2>

        <p>Rising above Rio de Janeiro, the Redeemer statue looks out over one of the most stunning coastlines on Earth. Construction began in 1926 and took nine years to complete. The white soapstone statue is not only an architectural achievement but also a symbol of hope and unity.</p>
        <h2>Machu Picchu:</h2>

        <p>Constructed in the 15th century, Machu Picchu was an Inca citadel located in Peru’s Andes mountain region. This remarkable site has gained mass appeal due to its inconceivable construction atop steep mountain ridges. These sacred grounds stretch a distance of five miles at an elevation of nearly 8,000 feet. They were abandoned 100 years after their construction, around the time of the Spanish conquest.</p>
        <h2>Chichen Itza:</h2>

        <p>Chichén Itzá is a complex of Mayan ruins on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. A massive step pyramid, known as El Castillo or Temple of Kukulcan, dominates the ancient city, which thrived from around 600 A.D. to the 1200s. Graphic stone carvings survive at structures like the ball court, Temple of the Warriors and the Wall of the Skulls. Nightly sound-and-light shows illuminate the buildings' sophisticated geometry.</p>
        <h2>The Colosseum:</h2>

        <p>The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is the largest standing amphitheatre in the world.</p>
        <h2>Taj Mahal:</h2>

        <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.</p>
